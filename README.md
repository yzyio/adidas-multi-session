**Deprecated:** This software was used on the old Yeezy splash pages on Adidas. Adidas renewed their website and this software hasnt been updated since.

adidas-multi-session is a open-source program to simulate multiple sessions on adidas queue pages.
It will open a x amounts of sessions in the background (depending on the num of proxies), when a session gets past queue/splash,
it will automatically open a Chrome window with the active session. This script is still in BETA and doesn't guarantee any 'cart'. It is actively developed.

### About

* Every x seconds the script will check for the hmac cookie or captcha field.
* If not found it will delete all cookies and try again, maximum 5 times and than try next IP/Proxy.
* If the cookie is found, the session will be transferred to a Chrome session.
* If you are using a proxy with authentication, you need to login first. The credentials are printed in the console.
* It will load the page with the cookies / ip / user-agent from the session that got past splash.
* If any problem occurs the cookies are also saved to cookies.txt. If there is no option to select size after opening chrome try adding it through wishlist or with Solemartyr's script.

### Frequently asked questions
#### Does this work?
It is never tested on a live release. So it is possible it won't work at all, will crash or let you cop a pair. It only increases your chances and is no 'bypass'.
A 'bypass' does not exists (atm) and all the popular ATC/Cook Groups/Mafias are using this same method but on a much larger scale.

#### Do I really need proxies?
Yes. Using the same IP doesn't make a difference.

#### Where can I buy proxies?
MyPrivateProxy (MPP): <a href="https://www.myprivateproxy.net/billing/aff.php?aff=1840">Website</a>.

I will update this README with more proxy providers. Make sure you pick sneaker proxies that work on adidas (for MPP).

#### I get Python 2/3 errors / Selenium says it's not installed
Make sure you use Python <b>3</b>. Run pip -V to see your Python version. If it says Python 2 search on Google how to change your default Python version for your platform.
